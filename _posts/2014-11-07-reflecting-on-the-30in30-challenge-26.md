[Wes][2] is right in his [blog post][3]: this is panning out to be quantity vs.
quality.

I'm finding that quality, informative, and worthwhile posts become
exponentially more difficult as posting frequency increases.  I've made
a commitment to myself to avoid the pitfall of regurgitated or fluff posts.
I'm trying not to post for the sake of posting.  It's made it difficult to make
a post every day, and yesterday's almost didn't happen.  I'm not really
convinced that there's in value in yesterday's post yet.

I have a few in the works that I think will be much more meaningful.  I don't
know if I'll be able to complete the challenge, but it's definitely increased
my brain activity and desire to write--which, I think, is the ultimate goal.

This post is part of the [#30in30 challenge][1].
