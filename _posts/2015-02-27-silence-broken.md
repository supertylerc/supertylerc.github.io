It's been a long time.  I made a failed attempt at the 30in30 challenge.  Why
did I fail?  To be honest, it wasn't a particularly realistic challenge.  It had
nearly the opposite effect: when things started happening in my personal life,
blogging took a backseat.  When things started quieting down, I was discouraged
by my failed attempt at the 30in30 challenge.  Now, I'm back.  And now I'm going
to tell you what I've learned since November.

# Cancer

Wow.  That's one hell of a headline, isn't it?  I wish I were just trying to
grab attention or generate click bait.  That's not the case.

In November, my girlfriend of three and a half years (it will be four in May!)
was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer.  We practically lived out of hospital for
two and a half weeks through multiple surgeries.  It was in the middle of
the American holiday known as Thanksgiving.

## Lessons Learned

One: never take anything you have for granted, especially not the people.  The
cancer diagnosis came out of nowhere, with no previous symptoms.  Not even
general illness.  One day she was very, very ill.  We immediately went to the
hospital and received the bad news.

Two: refuse negativity.  Just as automation and DevOps is more about culture
than tools, healing is really more about attitude than medicine.  Don't get me
wrong--without the medicine, you would never heal.  But even with medicine, if
you allow even the first negative thought into your life, you will never heal.

Three: always try to be the stronger person.  When you go through an event like
this, there will be days when your heart is so heavy you don't want to get out
of bed.  You will fear the worst.  You will break down, and you will cry, and
you will be on the verge of falling into a pit of despair from which you cannot
escape.  This goes along with number two: don't let negative thoughts creep into
your life.  As difficult as it is for you, it is infinitely more difficult for
the person suffering through the illness.  You must be stronger; you must
support whomever is going through the illness; you must make your collective
lives wonderful.  There will be days (many of them, it turns out) that will
contain arguments and difficulties.  Try to keep them to a minimum, and remember
how much you care for each other despite those arguments.

Four: you need support.  Friends or family, it doesn't matter.  This one is
especially difficult for me: I'm not particularly interested in sharing the
most secret parts of my life with anyone, no matter how close.  I've failed this
completely up to this point.  After talking to some very good people over the
past few days (hopefully you know who you are), I know this is something I
need to work very hard on.  Otherwise, I am doomed to fail on lessons two and
three.

# Old Struggles

My current work is a regular source of frustration and what I can only imagine
must be high blood pressure.  It's been this way for several months--since
before the cancer diagnosis--but it's been getting worse every day.  I
officially transitioned to a new team, but it's been a little less rosy than I
would have liked.  The grass is always greener on the other side, right?

## Lessons Learned

One: work sucks.  The things you have to do are the things you have to do--and
they usually suck.  At every job I've ever had, the things I **must** do have
always sucked.  But the things I **get** to do?  That's what makes it all worth
it.  Unfortunately, the things I **get** to do have been strangely absent from
my work life for the past several months.

Two: persevere.  Work sucks.  Sometimes, you don't get to do the things that you
want to--the things that are actually cool.  Sometimes, you don't get to do
those things for what seems like an eternity--days, weeks, months.  I'm going on
months now.  Perseverance is key.  You will return to do those things you love.

Three: make your own time.  This is one that I knew at one point in my life and
somehow managed to forget during the past three months.  Due to lessons one and
two, you must make your own time for doing cool things.  Sometimes lessons one
and two will bring you down--way, way down.  This is the only way to bring
yourself up and maintain that equilibrium.  It may suck at first to do things
that you might perceive as "work" outside of work hours, but if it's something
you genuinely love, it will be more rewarding than you can ever imagine.

# New Horizons

No lessons learned here because they're not quite here yet.  What I can tell
you: it's an exciting time to be in the networking industry.  There are
so many challenges that MPLS, segment routing, and TRILL will not solve.  We're
all poised to change the face of networking, but it's up to us to do it.

Rest assured that talking to a few key people recently has reminded me why I do
what I do.  Because I genuinely believe that these people have changed my life,
I'm going to call them out here.

[Lindsay Hill](https://twitter.com/northlandboy): I met you at NFD9.  You had
some good advice--inspiring words.  You made me consider aspects of what I do
that I hadn't considered.

[Tim Hoffman](https://twitter.com/hoffnz): You've been an incredible friend for
what feels like a long time.  In reality, it hasn't been long at all.  Listening
to you talk about cool stuff is always exciting.

[Graham Brown](https://twitter.com/mountainrescuer): You should probably hurry
up and move to San Francisco.  You've been a good--but distant--friend.  You're
an all-around great guy, and you've helped me out on more than one occassion.
Thank you.

[Josh O'Brien](https://twitter.com/joshobrien77): You've been a good person,
friend, advisor.  There aren't enough words to express my gratitude, and if I
had to pinpoint any one person as having the greatest impact on me--not just my
career, but my life--it is you.  Whether you know it or not, I look up to you,
and I consider you my mentor.  You may not have agreed to it, but tough shit.

[Jeremy Schulman](https://twitter.com/nwkautomaniac): Dude, do I even have to say anything?
You just get it--the networking industry and the pains that we're suffering.
Without the calls we had when I was still in South Carolina, without the help
you provided when I was starting out with network automation, I would still be
a [CLI Donkey](https://twitter.com/cli_donkey)--or at best a year or two behind.

[Thomas Cannon](https://twitter.com/surfnorcal): What's to say?  You brought me
out to California, you took care of me, and you helped me do great things.  You
are like family, like a brother.  We probably don't talk as much as we should.
We need to get a beer.

~~There is one person I've left off of this list because I don't want him to
think I'm brown-nosing or trying to flatter him.  I think that's the best
decision. When everything is finished, I'm going to make a point to add him
here, because he really deserves to be on this list.~~

[Mike Bushong](https://twitter.com/mbushong): I've talked to you once.  Holy
shit.  I don't know if I've ever known anyone as passionate and energetic as
you.  Just talking to you is inspiring, even if it is a monologue.  All joking
aside, no matter what happens, you're permanently on my radar and someone I
admire.  I look forward to whatever future interactions we might have.
Hopefully coffee/beer soon.

## Honorable Mentions

There are two people who I'll call "honorable mentions" just because they're a
hell of a lot of fun.  There's a third I'll add because I think he's an awesome
dude and I think we're just getting started.

> Edit: I've added a fourth that I somehow left off.  Once again, that guy is
> insane fun on the Twitters, and he deserves to know it.

[Wes Kennedy](https://twitter.com/whisky_kilo): You're too damn smart for your
own good.  Half the time, I'm in stitches just from the interactions between you
and my next honorable mention.

[Scott Pack](https://twitter.com/packscott): You and Wes are quite the pair.
Always good for a laugh.  And you've helped me out a few times and made
extremely generous offers that I had to pass on--maybe you have a better
understanding why I had to after reading this post.  Sorry I had to pass, and I
hope one day I'll be able to take you up on that Pathfinder game.

[Jon Hudson](https://twitter.com/the_solutioneer): I talked to you at NFD9 for
the first time.  We've had some interactions on the Twitters prior to that, but
I think talking to you at NFD9 really framed things for me.  I knew you were
smart, but holy hell--does your brain even fit in your head?!  And you're cool
as shit to boot.  I'm hoping we can get together for a beer on a semi-regular
basis.

[Ed Henry](https://twitter.com/networkn3rd): brah, do you even?!  what even is
this?  WHO EVEN ARE YOU!?  Seriously, you're a hell of a lot of fun.  Your
brain is pretty damn smart, too.  There are good things in your future--I
genuinely hope they bring you to San Francisco, because you're the kind of
person I want to have regular beers with.

## Why?

I've called you all out here because anyone can send e-mails.  Anyone can send
cards.  Not everyone can--or will--publicly acknowledge those who have been
more than colleagues and associates.  Thank you, all of you.
