[git][1] is a [distributed revision control system][2] for programmers,
writers, and anyone else who wants to have a way to track changes to
files.  It also lets you revert to previous changes if you need or want
to.  There are a lot of other features, like [branches][3], that can
make working on something without impacting production a dream.
