And now for something different...

# Reflections

I started the 30 in 30 challenge a little late.  I even cheated a little on my
first post.  But picking up the 30 in 30 inspired me to start blogging
again--and on a regular basis.  Chances are that no one is reading any of this,
but I'm not doing it for views.

## The Real Purpoose

Although the 30 in 30 challenge is encouraging us to create our own social
media, I think the real point is to make yourself think about
something--anything--every day.  In my day-to-day job, for example, there are
a lot of things I don't deal with every day anymore.  I don't debug TCP
packets, and I don't troubleshoot OSPF or BGP (daily, anyway).  I don't touch
MPLS at all anymore.

With all of that said, I shock myself at how much I still remember when the
pressure is on.  If I can force myself to think about these sorts of things
when writing--or just when thinking what I should write about next--then
hopefully I will be able to recall these sorts of things easier.  Ultimately,
I should be challenging myself to do new things with every post, not just
writing about things I already know like the back of my hand.

# Moving Forward

I've decided that every fifth post should be a reflection on the previous
segment as well as everything to date.  This should help me keep track of how
I'm feeling about the challenge and the challenges it places on me.

This post is part of the [#30in30 challenge][1].
