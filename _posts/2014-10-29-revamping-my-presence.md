I've recently decided to revamp my online presence.  It dawned on me that as
I continue to expand my skillset, limiting myself to a specific type of skill
to write about is bad.  Not only this, but writing should be an outlet of
myself, not just writing things of a strictly technical nature.

For those reasons, I've decided to revamp my online (social) presence.  Some
of the writing here might be non-technical, and some of it might not have
anything to do with networking.  You'll still find code, automation, Linux,
infrastructure, and networking here--and if you want just those things, you
can browse the categories and tags that are relevant.  I'll be tagging
everything non-technical with "personal" and/or "social."

This post also kicks off my response to the [#30in30 challenge][1].  Hopefully
I'll [last longer][2] than [the person who inspired me][3] to take on the challenge!
