This is just a brief rant.  Recently, I've discovered that some people just
aren't reading/responding to their e-mails.  Then they come ask me questions
about things I've already e-mailed them about.

Now, I'm with [Wes][2] and [his thoughts on e-mail][3].  The truth, though, is
that e-mail is a better tool for interdeparment and intercorporate
communications.  IM and chat don't really lend themselves very well to 1:1,
one-time communications.  Even with [HipChat][4] (which is awesome), it's
a real pin in the ass to search through the history if you don't remember
_exactly_ what was said.  E-mail, with the use of subject lines and tags,
makes it much easier to search.

Besides that, sending someone an IM offers no confirmation that they received
and understood the contents.  I can't tell you how many times I've sent IMs
that have been lost to the nether.  "No, I don't think you IM'd me."  Or "I
wasn't online."  And you ask them to search for the IM, and you get shit
responses for the reasons outlined above.

So yeah, I send e-mails.  And my e-mails usually contain everything you need to
know.  And then when your response is "I have 90,000 e-mails...I don't read
them," I really just want to throw bricks at your head.

Another irksome item is when I've written documentation on something, put it on
the Wiki, then e-mailed everyone about it...and then ten minutes later I get
asked how to do the very thing I just documented.  Please, just read your damn
e-mail.  It's not hard, and if you just archive/delete them as they come in,
it's a lot easier to manage.
