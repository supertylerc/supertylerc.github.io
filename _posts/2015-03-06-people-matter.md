This post kicks off my weekly **Lessons Learned** series.  In this series, I
talk about the lessons I've learned over the past week.  These tend to be
"life lessons," but sometimes they're also technical nuggets of excellence.
This series occurs every Friday.

# People Matter

The overarching theme from this past week is that people matter.  I've been
successful because of the people in my life, not because of anything I've
done on my own.  I have an awesome mentor--not just professionally, but in
life.

# Yes, No, and Arguments

Sometimes we argue about things, but frequently those arguments aren't really
worth having.  If it's a manager/employee relationship, and I just need to know
"yes" or "no," it's probably not worth arguing about 90% of the time.  Sure,
there will be times when it's just a really bad idea, but I've found that more
often than not, the argument doesn't matter.  It's a simple "yes" or "no," and
all of the fluff in between is just wasted resources.  I'm not saying that I
should always give up and trust those above me to have the correct opinion.

Wehn the only thing that matters is a "yes" or "no," the argument doesn't
matter.

# Some People Don't Get It

I can't hold it against them.  I can try to educate them, but at the end of the
day, if the argument wastes everyone's time and doesn't change anything, it may
just be better to skip the argument and accept that some people don't get it.
That doesn't make me better than them.  It just makes us different.  It means
we're at different points in our lives--personally or professionally.  And who
knows--maybe I'm the one that doesn't get it.  Regardless, it's not worth the
time and energy.

# Confidence is Important

It's taken me a long, long time to understand this, but it's changed my life.
Even if I don't know the answer, I need to have confidence when I say, "I
don't know."  It's okay if I don't know the answer--I can't know it all.  What
I can do, though, is say with confidence, "I don't know, but I can guarantee
that I can find out in short order."

This has changed almost every aspect of my life.  It's made it easier for me to
deal with people who may not know the answer.  It's made me feel more
comfortable when talking to people who are empirically smarter than I am.  I'm
no longer shying away from projects or prospective employers just because I
feel like I'm not capable.  My performance and productivity are way, way up.
My passion for technology has increased.  Life is just better.

# Take the Time to Think

It will **never** be the wrong choice to take 30 seconds to consider what the
other person in the conversation may be going through.  Unless the building is
literally on fire.

This is mostly a personal point, but it goes for technical conversations as
well.  Sometimes, I'm inclined to state, "No, this isn't possible," or, "This
will have X, Y, and Z problems."  Sometimes, I'm not entirely sure about that.
Sometimes, a co-worker indicates that he or she believes I may not be correct.
This goes along with confidence--it's okay for me to say, "I think this may
be the case, but let me do some research and get back to you."  Passion rules
our lives, though, and when we're passionate about what we do, it's easy for
things to get pretty heated.

# Don't Go Negative

I learned this one last year, but it hit home again this past week.  People
want to know more about network automation.  I need to teach them about it,
but I can't do it with negativity.  I can't tell them about the shortcomings
of RANCID to convince them that network automation is better.  RANCID is an
entrenched, beloved tool.  It has shortcomings, but people already know that.
I need to show people the advantages of network automation, the problems it
solves--not the applications it replaces.

"Network automation can provide configuration revision management."  Yeah, but
so does RANCID.  RANCID has problems, but not enough for someone to learn an
entirely new way of working.  "Good enough" is good enough, and it always will
be.  Instead, I should be telling people what network automation brings to the
table instead of telling them which RANCID problems it solves.  I need to avoid
mentioning pre-existing tools that network automation _might_ replace.
