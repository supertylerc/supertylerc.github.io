This week, I am on call as a Systems Administrator.  Any issue that arises is
my responsibility, 24 hours a day, for 7 days.

Traditionally, I'm a networking guy.  I sometimes write code, but I'll be the
first to admit that I'm not great at it.  Systems administration?  I'm
marginally better.

I've been on call as a Linux guy 4 times now.  It's a week of hell, partially
because we're in a true continuous deployment environment and partially because
we're still in the middle of standing up orchestration technologies everywhere.
I spend a week going crazy, and then I spend a week (or more) being completely
burned out.  Two to three weeks later (depending on who swaps on call with
whom), I'm back at it.

It's been bad enough that it's made me want out of operations.  But then I look
at other companies, and they seem to be handling on call responsibities and
time much better, so maybe it's better elsewhere.

Regardless, I'm out of my element when I'm on call for servers.  That might be
part of the frustration.  Add to that the fact that e-mail is the alerting
mechanism and that there is no night shift or NOC...

I know that I can't be on call as a Systems Administrator at my next job.
Something's always broken, and I don't have the skills necessary to quickly
resolve those broken things.  Will I perform SysAdmin duties?  Sure.  But not
on call.
