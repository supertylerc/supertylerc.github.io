# Hi.

I'm Tyler, and I do things.  What things?  Nothing special, but here's a
list I try to maintain.

## Ansible

I automate networks using Ansible.  I use Ansible to control every
aspect of network element configuration on Juniper Networks devices, and
I've started using it for F5 Networks Big IP LTMs.  I'm interested in
Ansible for Arista, but currently have no devices to test on.

## Integration

I also integrate networks.  From carrier-scale networks to startups,
I've been part of large integration projects at some stage for most of my
professional life.

* Carrier Integration at Windstream Communications
* Partner and Carrier Integration at Beats Music
* IP Integration at Adap.tv
* AWS VPC Design and Integration at Adap.tv

## Toolkit

### Asparagus UI and API

Temporarily add users to an LDAP group.  Makes SOX compliance
easier and increases security by essentially being a self-audit.
Written in Ruby/Rails and AngularJS.

### jping

Original Perl script parsed Juniper configuration and pinged all
subnets in all routing instances with an option to ignore a defined
regex of routing instances.  v2 was written in Python, used a
NETCONF library, and pulled its list of hosts to check from the ARP
table.

### LibreNMS

I was fortunate enough to help jumpstart LibreNMS.  I wrote some of
the scripts that brought it into a working state, including the
initial database migration script.  I wrote instructions for
installing and for a time helped manage commits.

A decent bit of my toolkit is featured on my GitHub, but some of it
isn't.  Some of it is so unique to a company that it made no sense to
open source.

### Development

* Rails API
* AngularJS Front End
* Bootstrap
* Ruby, Perl, and Python for Network Element Automation

### Acquisition

I've worked with resellers and vendors to acquire hardware, circuits,
contracts, and other necessary business items.  I've pushed them down on
price, and I've balanced business need, budget, and available products.

### Design

I performed network design for highly available networks, ensuring
maximum uptime for the network.  Parts of these designs included anycast
BGP, F5 LTM ADCs, and L3 extended to the TOR.
